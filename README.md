# TLM2.0 Sample UVM Code
## Description 
A demonstration of UVM TLM 2.0 Blocking and Non-Blocking Ports, accompanied by a Fundamental USB 2.0 Port Connection Illustration.

Transaction-Level Modeling (TLM) is a crucial aspect of the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) for efficient and modular verification. <br> This repository demonstrates the usage of TLM 2.0 features, specifically focusing on blocking and non-blocking ports, and provides a practical example of connecting ports using a basic USB 2.0 implementation.

## Features

- UVM TLM 2.0 blocking and non-blocking port implementations.
- Basic USB 2.0 implementation for illustrating port connections.
